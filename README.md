# packing-cost-diagrams

This repository contains PlantUML diagrams related to the packing cost calculation system.

## Diagrams

Here is a list of the diagrams in this project:

*   `Business Process To Be - CPS Creation (Activity Diagram).puml`: An activity diagram illustrating the business process for creating a CPS (Container Packing Specification).
*   `CPS Creation Cases.puml`: A diagram showing the different cases for CPS form creation.
*   `DPI creation state diagram.puml`: A state diagram that describes the different states of a DPI (Document of Packing Information) during its creation.
*   `ERD Approval Service.puml`: An Entity-Relationship Diagram for the Approval microservice.
*   `ERD Document Service.puml`: An Entity-Relationship Diagram for the Document microservice.
*   `ERD Notification Service.puml`: An Entity-Relationship Diagram for the Notification microservice.

*   `ppr generation activity diagram.puml`: An activity diagram for the PPR (Packing Price Report) generation process.

## How to View the Diagrams

To view these diagrams, you will need to install JDK which can be downloaded from: https://www.oracle.com/asean/java/technologies/downloads/  and have a PlantUML extension installed in your IDE. Here are some popular options:

*   **Visual Studio Code**: [PlantUML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml)
*   **IntelliJ IDEA**: [PlantUML integration](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7017-plantuml-integration)

Once you have the extension installed, you can open any of the `.puml` files and use the preview functionality (Win: Alt + D, Mac: Option + D) of the extension to see the rendered diagram.
